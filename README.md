## Description
- This is a portfolio that I have built to give people more of a background about me and my current role and to view some projects I have made. It was created with the React.js framework.
- As I went through this project, I was able to overcome many challeneges, such as figuring out how to use Routes and to understand hooks in React and they help make React a powerful framework to work in.
